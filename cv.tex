  \section{Summary}
    I'm a software developer based in Russia. First time I got interested in functional programming in 2014 but
    my skills were definitely lacking. After studying a bit of hard mathematics and graduating I find myself capable of
    trying it in a real environment.

    I used to do different jobs until I felt comfortable with my general IT experience.
