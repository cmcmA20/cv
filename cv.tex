  \section{Summary}
    I'm a software developer based in Russia, currently interested in functional programming, type theory and
    program verification.

    I used to do different jobs until I felt comfortable with my general IT experience.

      \textsc{Networking:} & designed and overseen the construction of enterprise ethernet
                             networks (up to a hundred of PCs, mainly copper and a bit of fiber) \\
                           & designed and overseen the construction of enterprise virtualization
                             cluster networks                                                    \\
                           & designed and developed a simple scalable VoIP system for enterprise
